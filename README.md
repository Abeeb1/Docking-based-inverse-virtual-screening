Evaluation of Docking-Based Inverse Virtual Screening

Identifying target proteins of drugs is crucial for understanding molecular mechanisms and minimizing side effects during drug development. However, experimentally screening all potential protein targets on a proteome-wide scale is impractical due to protein complexity. <img width="468" height="72" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59edf048-2455-4891-b0a7-eba492fbf049" />

Molecular docking methods has gained attention in inverse virtual screening (IVS) for target identification, drug repositioning, side effect prediction, and toxicity assessment. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic evaluation of docking methods for IVS exists, mainly due to the lack of appropriate benchmark datasets.<img width="468" height="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc182b95-5ff4-4183-b98a-f2ca74a8f15e" />

In this study, we present an improved benchmark, featuring 47 diverse FDA-approved drugs and 901 human proteins with experimentally determined three-dimensional (3D) structures, suitable for evaluating docking-based IVS methods. We systematically assessed AutoDock Vina, MDock, and ÔÅÑVinaXGB, demonstrating that docking-based IVS can enrich target identification. <img width="468" height="69" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/352dd82c-ece9-4135-8912-da7692ce246d" />
